# Project Info
Mateusz Jakusz - Portfolio webiste

Basic homepage which gives the user info about myself and may attract potential customers in future.

Page is created with one index.html for English version and also contain Polish version (indexPL.html)

#  UX
Page is divided into 6 anchor points and gives user ability to choose 2 languages (Polish or English)

1) About - general information about me .
2) Purpose- some information what is the purpose of proposed portfolio-project.
3) Skills - some information is provided according for frontend or backend developements.
4) Work - some already finished Project that a new customer can rely on.
5) Social - links to all my social media accounts.
6) Contact - simply form that allows user to contact me directely.
7) CV - Ability to download CV.

All the links for other websites are going to be opened in the new tabs. Links to the same page will remain in the same tab. <br/><br/>
NAVIGATION<br/><br/>
Navigation bar is always on the top of the page as it allows user to change any selection without special need of scrolling page up to the menu.<br/>
Navigation is simple it uses a dropdown menu for Language Selection (English & Polish).<br/>
Navigation is fully scallable. On Desktop Devices it uses full width of the screen, however it is not possible to see it in full using small devices (smartphones). To prevent that fact I used collapse JavaScript Plugin(bootstrap). <br/> 

As a part of design process I used very old-school technique, which is a blank paper and a pen. I used it to sketch how website should present more less than I gave it a content(information) and after I start to style it using CSS.


# Testing

Contact form was tested as it cannont be left empty in order to send me the message. It also verifies the email address to be valid.<br/>
All the files are downloadable and was tested for it. <br/>
Website was tested using 3 devices: Desktop PC, Tablet (Samsung a300) and smartphone (Samsung s8). Website was also tested using Inspect function in Google Chrome<br/>
# Deployement

Project is deployed @ GitHub. In future I plan to use OVH.ie hosting services and link it to the domain www.jakusz.org.<br/>
